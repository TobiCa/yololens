\section{Sketching}
The structure can look like this:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Present the chosen design challenges and some of the initial concerns in the beginning phase
	\item Each challenge is outlined with:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Sketches
			\item Design thoughts for the sketch - what was the thought behind this sketch?
			\item summary of the group discussion for this case - what worked, what didn't and why?
		\end{itemize}
	\item Conclude what the final sketches are - what do they accomplish, and what do they lack(maybe reference what might be discussed in future work)?
\end{itemize}
\subsection{How do we access the application? (Menu)}
The menu is an essential part of any application. It outlines the possibilities for the user in a simple fashion. The menu is something every user has experience with, as it is the first thing a user is met with when running an application. This means that the menu has to contain of certain classic elements.\par A user needs a way to close the application. On mobile phones nowadays this can be done with 'return' buttons on the phone, but all applications generally have a built in exit function.\par
The user also needs to have some sort of options menu, and guidelines. This is a must for this application. Stacking LEGO seems simple and intuitive, but all the operations and possibilities is something that can confuse a potential user. \par
Lastly the menu needs to have an easy access to the LEGO session itself. It shouldn't be complicated for the user to start a new LEGO session, meaning that this action should be as intuitive as it gets.\par
