\section{Conclusion}
The application presented in this report was equal parts a technical implementation as well as an experiment in how to test something as potentially overwhelming and new as Augmented Reality. We have discussed possible problems with testing subjects which have both the specific application to be tested as well as AR as completely new technological inputs and possible solutions to these problems.\\
In future work, more (thorough) testing needs to be done and a best practice as to how to test complete beginners in an application utilizing Augmented Reality. Furthermore, the LEGO application itself needs more bricks and functionality to ease the interaction with said bricks.
